Codes in this branch will adhere to the method of adapting CPML to dispersive media as suggested by Taflove in
Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-DIfference Time-Domain Method, 3rd ed., Section 7.10, pg 310.
The medium of choice will be the Drude-Dispersive medium of the single-slit code, which will permeate the
entire grid, including the CPML-laden boundaries.

CPML_Drude_2D

Boundary Conditions: Reflecting in Y, Periodic in X
Source: Current Source - Amalgamated Plane Wave
ABC: CPML adapted to Drude Dispersion, as detailed in Taflove 3rd ed. Section 7.10, pg 310
Scattering: Drude-Disperion throughout (no vacuum)
Output: Grid-Return
