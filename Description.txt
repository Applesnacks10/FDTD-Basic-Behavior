This is the (somewhat arbitrary) starting point for my first version control tryout with FDTD.
I have decided to first partition my versions by their dimensionality (i.e., I will have separate 1D, 2D,
and 3D branches).

As a result, I have created three codes to be put into the master branch
Basic_1D_Inactual
Basic_2D
Basic_3D_Inactual

My Plan for These Codes:
Currently, all three codes have the same dimensionality -- 2D. This is the reason for the _Inactual labels;
they indicate that the codes do not currently have the characteristics designated by their other title-info.
Because I am not starting with 1D and 3D codes, I will have to create 1D and 3D codes from their _Inactual
counterparts, for which I will make branches. Once the codes are in their intended forms, I will pull them
back to master, then create a commit where their names are changed and the _Inactual codes are deleted.

Since all three codes have the same content (only their names differ), to describe one is to describe all.
Characteristics of Basic_2D:

Field Domain: Transverse Electric(Ex,Ey,Hz)
Boundary Conditions: Periodic in Y, Reflecting in X
Source: Electric Pulse
ABC: None
Scattering: None
Output: Grid-Return
