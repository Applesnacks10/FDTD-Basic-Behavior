This Branch marks a goal-change.
Rather than implementing both the Drude model and the Drude-adapted CPML at the same time, I will implement
the Drude model first

Drude_Permeate_2D

Boundary Conditions: Reflecting in Y, Periodic in X
Source: Current Source - Amalgamated Plane Wave
ABC: None
Scattering: Drude-Disperion throughout (no vacuum)
Output: Grid-Return

First Run 
Resulted in an upward-creeping wave of Divergence, seemingly emanating from the bottom of the grid.
May be due to current souce inside Drude material.
Proposed solution: add a vacuum cavity in which the current source will reside.
