This branch will consist of the addition of a current-source for 1D, and possibly 2D, codes.
Initially, a singe oscillating dipole will be added (a point-source in the discretization).
This is what Current-Source_Point_1D contains.
My plans for progression are as follows. At each step, I will verify that the simulation behaves as expected.

Point source 1D --> Amalgamated source 1D --> Amalgamated source 2D

For each Amalgamated source, I will try to replicate the wave featuerd in single-slit

Current-Source_Point_1D
Boundary Conditions: Reflecting
Source: single oscillating dipole
ABC: None
Scattering: None
Output: Grid-Return

Current-Source_Amalgamated_1D
Boundary Conditions: Reflecting in X and Y
Source: many oscillating currents superposed at one point
ABC: None
Scattering: None
Output: Grid-Return

Current-Source_Amalgamated_2D
Boundary Conditions: Periodic in Y, Reflecting in X
Source: a line of current sources, each a superposition of oscillations (Plane Wave) 
ABC: None
Scattering: None
Output: Grid-Return
