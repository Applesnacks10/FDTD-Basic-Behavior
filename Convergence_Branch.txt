I will be creating the Convergence test in Function form, so as to be able to apply it
easily to any simulation. At the end, I may test it with the code FDTD_3D, since its CPML
is supposedly known to work. The formulation will take 3 dimensions into account and output
the magnitude of the "Total Poynting Vector" (|E x H|) for a recti-formed space whose
dimensions are determined by input.
